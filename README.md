## About the Game
Trend Try is a 2D dress-up game built in Unity that allows players to experiment with trendy clothy items in a fun, low-pressure environment. Players can mix and match outfits and explore with their fashion without actually needing to buy anything.

The game pushes for creativity and self-expression and curating one's own sense of style in a sustainable and cost-effective way. As someone heavy on thrifting and secondhand fashion, I feel this is a playful way to combat overconsumption in my own way.
